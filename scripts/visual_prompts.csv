The transport activity of substrates L-thyroxine (T4) and 3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine (reverse T3, rT3) is much greater than that of 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) (PubMed:15166123). The prehormone, T4, is the major form in the circulating blood and is converted to the active form, T3, by the iodothyronine-deiodinase in peripheral organs (PubMed:15166123). T3 plays an essential role in brain development via binding to specific nuclear receptors (thyroid hormone receptor) (PubMed:15166123, PubMed:22294745). Also transports organic anions such as the conjugated steroid 17-beta-glucuronosyl estradiol (17beta-estradiol 17-O-(beta-D-glucuronate)) (PubMed:15166123). Transports T4 and estrone-3-sulfate in a pH-insensitive manner (By similarity).

SLCO2A1,HeLa cells with SLCO2A1 knockdown showing high migration (distance),"SLCO2A1 normally functions as Mediates the transport of prostaglandins (PGs, mainly PGE2, PGE1, PGE3, PGF2alpha, PGD2, PGH2) and thromboxanes (thromboxane B2) across the cell membrane (PubMed:10484490, PubMed:11880322, PubMed:11997327, PubMed:15044627, PubMed:15855165, PubMed:20346915, PubMed:7754369). PGs and thromboxanes play fundamental roles in diverse functions such as intraocular pressure, gastric acid secretion, renal salt and water transport, vascular tone, and fever (PubMed:15044627). Plays a role in the clearance of PGs from the circulation through cellular uptake, which allows cytoplasmic oxidation and PG signal termination (PubMed:11997327, PubMed:15044627, PubMed:7754369). PG uptake is dependent upon membrane potential and involves exchange of a monovalent anionic substrate (PGs exist physiologically as an anionic monovalent form) with a stoichiometry of 1:1 for divalent anions or of 1:2 for monovalent anions (By similarity). Uses lactate, generated by glycolysis, as a counter-substrate to mediate PG influx and efflux (PubMed:11997327). Under nonglycolytic conditions, metabolites other than lactate might serve as counter-substrates (PubMed:11997327). Although the mechanism is not clear, this transporter can function in bidirectional mode (By similarity). When apically expressed in epithelial cells, it facilitates transcellular transport (also called vectorial release), extracting PG from the apical medium and facilitating transport across the cell toward the basolateral side, whereupon the PG exits the cell by simple diffusion (PubMed:11880322, PubMed:15044627, PubMed:15855165). In the renal collecting duct, regulates renal Na+ balance by removing PGE2 from apical medium (PGE2 EP4 receptor is likely localized to the luminal/apical membrane and stimulates Na+ resorption) and transporting it toward the basolateral membrane (where PGE2 EP1 and EP3 receptors inhibit Na+ resorption) (PubMed:15855165). Plays a role in endometrium during decidualization, increasing uptake of PGs by decidual cells (By similarity). Involved in critical events for ovulation (By similarity). Regulates extracellular PGE2 concentration for follicular development in the ovaries (By similarity). Expressed intracellularly, may contribute to vesicular uptake of newly synthesized intracellular PGs, thereby facilitating exocytotic secretion of PGs without being metabolized (By similarity).

May contribute to regulate the transport of organic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (By similarity). Shows a pH-sensitive substrate specificity which may be ascribed to the protonation state of the binding site and leads to a stimulation of substrate transport in an acidic microenvironment. The exact transport mechanism has not been yet deciphered but most likely involves an anion exchange, coupling the cellular uptake of organic substrate with the efflux of an anionic compound. Hydrogencarbonate/HCO3(-) acts as a probable counteranion that exchanges for organic anions. Cytoplasmic glutamate may also act as counteranion in the placenta.
