Each sample has a gene knockdown.
We have three genes that promote cell division: KIF11, INCENP, COPB1
If any of these is knocked down, it should depromote cell divsion.

FOR KIF11, INCENP, COPB1 respectively:
Score - increased proliferation (automatic)   -1.042692
Score - increased proliferation (automatic)   -0.574120
Score - increased proliferation (automatic)   -0.561010


By picking videos with these knockdown, we get a sample of videos with low proliferation. 

With gene symbol none (so no knockdown):
Score - increased proliferation (automatic)    0.005278
