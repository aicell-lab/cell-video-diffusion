Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Required for maximal ATPase activity of SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A and for association of the SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A containing remodeling complex BAF with chromatin/nuclear matrix. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and is required for the proliferation of neural progenitors. During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (PubMed:17640523).

Plays an essential role in skeletal and dental mineralization via its ability to hydrolyze extracellular diphosphate, a potent mineralization inhibitor, to phosphate: it thereby promotes hydroxyapatite crystal formation and increases inorganic phosphate concentration.

The SNX-BAR retromer mediates retrograde transport of cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is involved in endosome-to-plasma membrane transport for cargo protein recycling. The SNX3-retromer mediates the retrograde endosome-to-TGN transport of WLS distinct from the SNX-BAR retromer pathway. The SNX27-retromer is believed to be involved in endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking and recycling of a broad spectrum of cargo proteins. The CSC seems to act as recruitment hub for other proteins, such as the WASH complex and TBC1D5. Required to regulate transcytosis of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR-pIgA) (By similarity). Acts also as component of the retriever complex. The retriever complex is a heterotrimeric complex related to retromer cargo-selective complex (CSC) and essential for retromer-independent retrieval and recycling of numerous cargos such as integrin alpha-5/beta-1 (ITGA5:ITGB1). In the endosomes, retriever complex drives the retrieval and recycling of NxxY-motif-containing cargo proteins by coupling to SNX17, a cargo essential for the homeostatic maintenance of numerous cell surface proteins associated with processes that include cell migration, cell adhesion, nutrient supply and cell signaling. The recruitment of the retriever complex to the endosomal membrane involves CCC and WASH complexes. Involved in GLUT1 endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking; the function is dependent of association with ANKRD27 (By similarity). Has no activity towards p-nitrophenylphosphate, p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine or phosphatidylinositlphosphates or a phosphorylated peptide derived from retromer cargo (in vitro) (PubMed:15965486, PubMed:21629666)"
WDR31,HeLa cells with WDR31 knockdown showing high migration (distance) and increased proliferation,
WDR92,HeLa cells with WDR92 knockdown showing high migration (distance),WDR92 normally functions as Key assembly factor specifically required for the stability of axonemal dynein heavy chains in cytoplasm
WWOX,HeLa cells with WWOX knockdown showing high migration (distance),"WWOX normally functions as Putative oxidoreductase. Acts as a tumor suppressor and plays a role in apoptosis. May function synergistically with p53/TP53 to control genotoxic stress-induced cell death. Plays a role in TGFB1 signaling and TGFB1-mediated cell death. May also play a role in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated cell death. Required for normal bone development. Inhibits Wnt signaling, probably by sequestering DVL2 in the cytoplasm (By similarity)"
XK,HeLa cells with XK knockdown showing high migration (distance) and migration (speed),XK normally functions as Recruits the lipid transfer protein VPS13A from lipid droplets to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane
YWHAE,HeLa cells with YWHAE knockdown showing high migration (distance),"YWHAE normally functions as Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways. Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif (PubMed:35343654). Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner (By similarity). Positively regulates phosphorylated protein HSF1 nuclear export to the cytoplasm (PubMed:12917326). Plays a positive role in the antiviral signaling pathway upstream of TBK1 via interaction with RIGI (PubMed:37555661). Mechanistically, directs RIGI redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondrial associated membranes where it mediates MAVS-dependent innate immune signaling during viral infection (PubMed:22607805). Plays a role in proliferation inhibition and cell cycle arrest by exporting HNRNPC from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to be degraded by ubiquitination (PubMed:37599448)"
ZADH2,HeLa cells with ZADH2 knockdown showing high migration (distance),"ZADH2 normally functions as Functions as 15-oxo-prostaglandin 13-reductase and acts on 15-keto-PGE1, 15-keto-PGE2, 15-keto-PGE1-alpha and 15-keto-PGE2-alpha with highest efficiency towards 15-keto-PGE2-alpha. Overexpression represses transcriptional activity of PPARG and inhibits adipocyte differentiation"
